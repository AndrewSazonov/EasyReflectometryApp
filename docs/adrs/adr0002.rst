Context 
-------

In order to have EasyReflectometry (both as an application and a Python library) accessible to as many users as possible, it is important that the software can be installed as easily as possible. 
For the Python library, this means that :mod:`EasyReflectometryLib` should be installable via PyPI with the command: 

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install EasyReflectometryLib

As is outlined in `ADR0001`_.
:mod:`EasyReflectometryApp` should be installable, either via PyPI with a similar command or via an installer executable (or by :code:`snap` image). 
These executables should be built for Windows, macOS, and Linux (ubuntu) and should include the same functionality in each and should be available to all. 

Decision
--------

New releases of :mod:`EasyReflectometryLib` and :mod:`EasyReflectometryApp` should be uploaded to PyPI in an automated fashion, using an `appropriate Github action`_ with each **new release**. 
Similarly, new executables and :code:`snap` image should be prepared in an automated fashion also using Github actions. 
The details of the continuous integration for the executables will be documented within `these pages`_ and updated with any changes and any breakages documented.
In future, the CI for the building of the :mod:`EasyReflectometryApp` may be removed from the main :mod:`EasyReflectometryApp` repository and moved to a new repository (under the :mod:`EasyScience` Github organisation), such that is may be used by other EasyApplications.
The installers will be made available on the `easyreflectometry.org`_ main page for download by all interested users. 

Consequences
------------

The continuous integration of PyPI builds, executable installers, and :code:`snap` images should be completed (update when completed with git hash). 
The executable installer and :code:`snap` continuous integration should be documented in these pages, and any changes updated (update when completed with git hash). 
In future, we will investigate sharing this continuous integration across the :mod`EasyScience` organisation to include :mod:`EasyDiffraction`.
