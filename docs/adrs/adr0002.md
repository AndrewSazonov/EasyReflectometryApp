## Context 

In order to have EasyReflectometry (both as an application and a Python library) accessible to as many users as possible, it is important that the software can be installed as easily as possible. 
For the Python library, this means that `EasyReflectometryLib` should be installable via PyPI with the command: 

```console
$ pip install EasyReflectometryLib
```

As is outlined in [ADR0001](./adr0001).
`EasyReflectometryApp` should be installable, either via PyPI with a similar command or via an installer executable (or by `snap` image). 
These executables should be built for Windows, macOS, and Linux (ubuntu) and should include the same functionality in each and should be available to all. 

## Decision

New releases of `EasyReflectometryLib` and `EasyReflectometryApp` should be uploaded to PyPI in an automated fashion, using an [appropriate Github action](https://github.com/easyScience/easyCore/blob/master/.github/workflows/python-publish.yml) with each **new release**. 
Similarly, new executables and `snap` image should be prepared in an automated fashion also using Github actions. 
The details of the continuous integration for the executables will be documented within [these pages](/ci) and updated with any changes and any breakages documented.
In future, the CI for the building of the `EasyReflectometryApp` may be removed from the main `EasyReflectometryApp` repository and moved to a new repository (under the `EasyScience` Github organisation), such that is may be used by other EasyApplications.
The installers will be made available on the [easyreflectometry.org](https://easyreflectometry.org) main page for download by all interested users. 

## Consequences

The continuous integration of PyPI builds, executable installers, and `snap` images should be completed (update when completed with git hash). 
The executable installer and `snap` continuous integration should be documented in these pages, and any changes updated (update when completed with git hash). 
In future, we will investigate sharing this continuous integration across the `EasyScience` organisation to include `EasyDiffraction`.
